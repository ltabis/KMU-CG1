# KMU-CG1
Doing some rendering with C++ and OpenGL.

## Goal

Create a simple renderer that could be integrated into a game engine.
It will first support 2D, then eventually 3D.
It won't we necesserly optimised all the way, this project is used mainly to learn opengl and mathematics.

The renderer is tested using a custom test framework located in the CG1/src/Tests folder.

*Current version*: 0.23.0
